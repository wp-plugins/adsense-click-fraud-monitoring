= Why i need AdSense Click Fraud Monitoring Plugin? =

* Prevent malicious clicks by bots on your Ads
* Prevent malicious clicks by human user on you Ads
* Prevent clicks by friends on your Ads who want to “help” you.
* Prevent unintended clicks by your own
* New: Blocks a list of specific IP´s including detection of your own IP
* New: Use custom name for your ad block class
* New: Blocks a comma separated list of specific IP´s including detection of your own IP

In easy words, e.g. Google AdSense: Google takes care that every click on any AdSense advertising is done by a real human visitor. Automatic clicks by crawl bots or a lot of automated or manual processed clicks (a so-called Clickbomb) can lead to a complete and permanent exclusion from the google AdSense service. All your earnings are lost and it is very hard to get back the access to your account. (In most cases impossible)
The motivation behind such automatic clicks is very different. Maybe some competitior wants to harm you or a technical leads to multiple clicks by a human user. They all have in common that you as the AdSense account owner are responsible for any click fraud. You recognize unusual clicks when your page CTR is 1 - 3 % averaged and than it jumps up to 5, 10 or even more. 

This is were the "Click Fraud Monitor" comes in...for prevention!

= Features =

* Disable your Ads when a user clicks too often on them
* User will be banned and blocked for further clicks
* Manual unblocking of IP adresses possible
* Works, even without reloading of your site (jQuery and Ajax)
* Works with every Theme
* E-Mail notification when a user is blocked (Only Premium)
* Activating and disabling of all Ads with only one click
* Works in content, sidebar and widget section
* Simple installation and setup
* No garbage: Removes all plugin tables and settings in the WP database
* Service and support by the author
* Periodic updates and improvements. (Feel free to make your wish)

= How does it work? =

The Plugin counts all clicks on your Ads. When the clicks exceeds a specified number, the ad will be deactivated and removed from the source code. The clicking user or bot is blocked on a IP basis for further clicks. At the same time the plugin sends you a notification by email. (Only Premium)
 
= How to install and setup? =
Install this plugin and wrap your AdSense or other advertising code into a new div with the class "cfmonitor". 

For AdSense your code should look like: `<div class="cfmonitor">YOUR AdSense CODE HERE</div>`

From now on every click on your ads are counted by the IP and current user session. If the clicks reach a adjusted number of clicks within a specified timerange, the advertising is deactivated for that visitor and no further click fraud is possible. If that happens, you´ll get a email notofication and are able to see in the admin panel what´s going on by a list of blocked visitors.
If there should be a larger attack on your site with a lot of different IP´s you are able to hide all advertisings complete or only selected by country. That helps enourmous to react and investigate the case without loosing too much of your earnings.

Google is pretty good to recognize a few mistaken clicks but a larger attack should be reported at the official Google contact form [Invalid Clicks Contact Form](https://support.google.com/adsense/contact/invalid_clicks_contact?hl=en"Invalid Clicks contact form")
